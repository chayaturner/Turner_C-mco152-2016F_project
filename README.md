Semester Project for Computer Methodology


This is a program that will allow users to input the foods and physical activity that they eat and do each day. 
Our program will evaluate the health benefits of the food that each user is eating, and tell give them follow-up details.
It will also evaluate and suggest beneficial excercize activities. 

Users can track their progress, and the program will tell them the percentage of how much they completed during the day,
and suggest other things they can do. 

As we continue, we will add more features based on things we learn. 

Time-permitting, we can also add a schedulizer, which the user can add reminders, which can give notifications until completed.
