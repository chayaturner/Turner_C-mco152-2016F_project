Semester Project for Computer Methodology

Recipe Book:
This is a program that will allow users to add, view, edit, and organize recipes.  
Our program will allow users to store their favorite recipes, and perhaps share them with friends. 
We will possibly help calculate the health benefits/calories of the recipes that users save.

As we continue, we will add more features based on things we learn.
